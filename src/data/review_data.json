As a seasoned surfer, I've tested out my fair share of wetsuits, and I have to say that this one really impressed me.\n\nLet's start with the features. The Roxy Syncro is made of 100% F'N Lite superstretch neoprene, which means you can move around freely and comfortably in the water. It also has sealed seams and a Hydroshield water barrier to keep the cold water out, so you can stay in the water longer without freezing your buns off. And if you're surfing on a sunny day, you'll appreciate the Thermal smoothie panels that capture and retain heat.\n\nBut what really sold me on this wetsuit is the Warmflight Far Infrared x1 thermal inner lined panels. Not only do they provide extra warmth, but they also dry quickly, which is essential for those of us who like to surf multiple times a day. The durable kneepads and key loop are also nice touches.\n\nWho would this wetsuit be a good fit for? I think it's perfect for intermediate to advanced female surfers who want a high-quality wetsuit that will last them at least a season or two. It's also ideal for those who prioritize comfort and flexibility, but don't want to sacrifice style.\n\nNow, let's break it down with a quick pros and cons list:\n\nPros:\n- Superstretch neoprene for maximum flexibility\n- Sealed seams and Hydroshield water barrier to keep out the cold water\n- Thermal smoothie panels for sun heat capture and retention\n- Warmflight Far Infrared x1 thermal inner lined panels for extra warmth and quick drying\n- Durable kneepads and key loop\n- Stylish design\n\nCons:\n- Only comes in two color options (black and blue)\n\nIn conclusion, the Roxy Womens 4/3 Syncro Back Zip GBS Wetsuit is a fantastic choice for female surfers who want a high-quality wetsuit that will keep them warm, comfortable, and stylish. It has a lot of great features that make it stand out from the competition, and the price is reasonable for the quality you're getting. I highly recommend giving it a try!\n\nBottom line: 8.5/10",
